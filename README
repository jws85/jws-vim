This is a giant abomination of a vim configuration, done by someone who
used emacs for three years.  It's been evolving for about three months
now...

To install, you need
 * vim (duh)
    - has to be compiled with Python and Ruby support
    - preferably also compiled with GUI support
 * git (so Vundle can pull down what it needs)
 * Exuberant ctags (for EasyTag)

To install, first back up your old .vim/ directory as well as .vimrc
and .gvimrc.  (If you skipped over that sentence, please go back and
make sure you did all of that!)  Then:
 - git clone git@github.com:jws85/jws-vim.git ~/.vim
 - cd ~/.vim
 - ./install.sh (This will create a lot of output.  Pray to whatever
   deity you believe in (or don't :P) that it works)

This configuration Works For Me(tm) and I give no warranty that it will
do the same for you.

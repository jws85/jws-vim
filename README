This is a giant abomination of a vim configuration, done by someone who
used emacs for three years.  It's been evolving for about three months
now...

To install, you need
 * vim (duh)
    - has to be compiled with Python and Ruby support
    - preferably also compiled with GUI support
 * git (so Vundle can pull down what it needs)

To install, first back up your old .vim/ directory as well as .vimrc
and .gvimrc.  (If you skipped over that sentence, please go back and
make sure you did all of that!)  Then run install.sh and pray.

This configuration Works For Me(tm) and I give no warranty that it will
do the same for you.

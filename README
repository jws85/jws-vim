Do NOT use my vimrc before reading this file, then reading through everything
in the *.vim files here!

To install, you need
 * vim (duh)
 * git

Then /just/ do the following (at this point it's kind of a lot of work):

git submodule init
git submodule update
vim -u vundle.vim +BundleInstall +q
mkdir plugin
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/plugin/DBGp-client/plugin/debugger.vim plugin
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/plugin/DBGp-client/plugin/debugger.py plugin
cd ..
mkdir site
cp site/all.vim.sample site/all.vim
cp site/gui.vim.sample site/gui.vim
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/vimrc.vim ~/.vimrc
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/gvimrc.vim ~/.gvimrc

Fill out all.vim and gui.vim with your preferences.  If you want to change
vimrc.vim or gvimrc.vim, you'll be better served by forking this git project
unless you make the changes by my blessing.  all.vim.sample is (intentionally)
blank; gui.vim.sample has some settings for fonts, window positioning, etc
that I use at work but expect to need to change for individual machines.

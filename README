This is a giant abomination of a vim configuration, done by someone who
used emacs for three years.  It's been evolving for almost a year now.

To install, you need
 * vim (duh)
    - has to be compiled with Python and Ruby support
    - preferably also compiled with GUI support
 * git (so Vundle can pull down what it needs)
 * make (Command-T)

To install, first back up your old .vim/ directory as well as .vimrc
and .gvimrc.  (If you skipped over that sentence, please go back and
make sure you did all of that!)  Then:
 - git clone git@github.com:jws85/jws-vim.git ~/.vim
 - cd ~/.vim
 - ./install.sh (This will create a lot of output.  Pray to whatever
   deity you believe in (or don't :P) that it works)
 - Manually go into bundle/Command-T/ruby/command-t and run the
   commands
    ruby extconf.rb
    make

There is probably some further tweaking that needs to be done and
documented, but meh.

This is pretty much one giant glop of code, a lot of which I am not
actively using.  However, here's what I use different things for:
 - vundle:  Provides package management for this insane pile of junk

 - LustyExplorer:  Fast file finding and buffer switching.
 - LustyJuggler:  Even faster buffer switching
 - Command-T:  Even faster file finding
   The thing is, LustyExplorer is great if you want to type the full
   path name to whatever it is you're finding.  Command-T excels at
   giving it a project directory and then you just type part of the
   filename to find something.  So they complement each other.

 - Conque-Shell:  To run ipython/phpsh (and irb/sbcl) in the same
   window as vim

 - surround.vim:  Lets you wrap selected text in braces, HTML tags, etc
 - closetag.vim:  Lets you close HTML/XML tags
   I simply cannot live without these.

The rest of it is just kind of there.

This configuration Works For Me(tm) and I give no warranty that it will
do the same for you.

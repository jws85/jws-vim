I would suggest reading this, then reading the files 'vimrc.vim' and
'gvimrc.vim' before installing, just so you "know what you're getting."
I'd also suggest backing up your old .(g)vimrc and .vim/ folder.

To install, you need
 * vim (duh)
    - has to be compiled with Python and Ruby support
    - preferably also compiled with GUI support
 * git (so Vundle can pull down what it needs)

There is a rough, untested script that purports to do the below things.
Until I get it working, just do these things (yes it's a pain):

cp -r [the folder with all this stuff in it] ~/.vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
vim -u vundle.vim +BundleInstall +q
mkdir plugin
cp site/all.vim.sample site/all.vim
cp site/gui.vim.sample site/gui.vim
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/vimrc.vim ~/.vimrc
ln -s /home/yourname/.vim/gvimrc.vim ~/.gvimrc

Fill out all.vim and gui.vim with your preferences.  If you want to
change vimrc.vim or gvimrc.vim, you'll be better served by forking
this git project unless you make the changes by my blessing.
all.vim.sample is (intentionally) blank; gui.vim.sample has some
settings for fonts, window positioning, etc. that I use at work but
expect to need to change for individual machines.

I would keep in mind that my vim setup does not reflect the mindset of
the 'vi'-style users.  I was an emacs user for three years, and while I
left mostly because 1) it tried to "intelligently" guess what you wanted
(e.g. indentation) and turned out to be very difficult to turn those
features off and 2) the keymap is bogus, I still largely agree with its
general philosophy of avoiding program switching unless absolutely
necessary.  As a result, my setup is very "extension"-centric and is
not minimal at all.

(Expanding on #1:  All of Emacs' PHP modes use HTML modes as well (or
seem to).  Seemed to me like all of the HTML modes assumed you were
doing SGML/XHTML which is *not* what I have at work, and autoindenting
would ruin everything with as little as a <br> that did not have the
closing slash <br />.  Which, given this codebase, is... somewhat
suboptimal.  On top of this, mumamo had fontifying and line-numbering
issues and vim was just faster.  I've not used emacs in a month and a
half and I've not missed it a bit except when dinking about with lisp.)
